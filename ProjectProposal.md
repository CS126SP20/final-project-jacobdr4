#Pixel Paint
Author: Jacob Rubin

For my final project, I will be making a canvas application,
like Microsoft Paint. It will have a variety of drawing tools
to choose from like a pencil, highlight, shape, and fill tool. It will
also have a save feature for the picture that the user draws to be
stored in an external file that can be reopened. 

I want to do this project because I think it's a cool intersection
between art and programming. I'm looking forward to programming
a user interface for this and all the ways I can enable it to 
make art. It's also something I can continue to play with when it's
done, which is a plus.

I plan to use coc-ui to make my ui. 
It is useful for making buttons, which I will need in order
to let the user select a tool. It also comes with a scroller
feature, which will be useful if I make a menu screen.

By week one, I want to be done with the user interface. This
includes all of the buttons and the canvas. I would also like
to be able to draw on the canvas.

By week two, I want to finish implementing the pencil, highlight,
shape, and fill tool. I also want to add a color selector of
some sorts so the user can change the color of their tool.

By week three, I want to finish the saving and loading functionality. 
So saving a project to a file and importing one from a file.

If I have additional time, I would like to add a menu screen to 
select a project that the user has made. I would also add
a complex color wheel. 

Importing images from internet. Use a JSON file or other means 
to store image.
