# Documentation for my final project

Pixel Paint is a canvas application for creating artwork. Use the mouse to draw
anything!

There are nine different tools that can be selected on the top-left menu:
1. Line: Draws a straight line. Click and hold where you want to place the start of 
the line, and drag the mouse to where you want the line to end. Release the mouse when 
finished.
2. Scribble: Doodle anything on the screen. Click and hold the mouse
to draw, release when finished.
3. Rect: Draws a rectangle. Click and hold where you want to place a corner of 
the rectangle, and drag the mouse to change the size. Release the mouse when 
finished.
4. Ellipse: Draws an ellipse. Click and hold where you want to place a "corner" of 
the ellipse, and drag the mouse to change the size. Release the mouse when 
finished.
5. Fill: Changes the background color. Adjust the color slider to 
change the background color.
6. Clear: Clears the display of all drawings. Does not change the background color.
7. Undo: Deletes the last shape drawn 
8. Save: Saves the current display to later use. (Note: Data does not save between run sessions)
9. Load: Loads the last saved display

There is also a multislider below the tools to change the color of your tool
before you draw. Drag the sliders to change the red, green, and blue
values of the color. The selected color will appear on the border of the sliders.
