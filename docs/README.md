# Documentation for my final project

Pixel Paint is a canvas application for creating artwork. Use the mouse to draw
anything!

There are five different tools that can be selected on the top-left menu:
1. Clear: Draw a straight line. Click and hold where you want to place the start of 
the line, and drag the mouse to where you want the line to end. Release the mouse when 
finished.
2. Scribble: Doodle anything on the screen
3. Rect: Draws a rectangle. Click and hold where you want to place the top-left corner of 
the rectangle, and drag the mouse to change the size. Release the mouse when 
finished.
4. Fill: Changes the background color
5. Clear: Clears the display of all drawings

There is also a multislider below the tools to change the color of your tool
before you draw. Drag the sliders to change color. The selected color will
appear on the border of the sliders.
